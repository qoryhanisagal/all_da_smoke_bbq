# Catering Management Web Application

## Project Overview

This document outlines the updated vision and scope for a **Catering Management Web Application**, tailored for a mobile-first experience using **React**, **Tailwind CSS**, **Bootstrap**, and **Firebase**. The goal is to upgrade the existing food truck website to a robust, scalable platform that supports catering operations, with emphasis on **Order Management**, **Menu Management**, **Recipe Management**, and a highly responsive **UI design**.

## I. Key Features

### A. Order Management
- **Order Creation**: Create new orders with customized food selections and quantities.
- **Order Editing**: Modify items or quantities, add notes (e.g., dietary needs).
- **Order Status Tracking**: Manage workflow stages ("Received", "Preparing", "Delivered", "Completed").
- **Order History**: Maintain a searchable, filterable history for clients and internal review.

### B. Menu Management
- **Dynamic Menu Editor**: Add/update/remove items, categories, and pricing.
- **Item Availability Toggle**: Instantly mark items as "Available" or "Out of Stock".
- **Descriptions & Photos**: Visual and textual enhancement for each item.
- **Category Organization**: Logical grouping of menu items (e.g., "Appetizers", "Mains").

### C. Recipe Management
- **Ingredient Management**: Track ingredients, costs, and units of measurement.
- **Recipe Builder**: Create and edit recipes, linking ingredients with quantities.
- **Cost-per-Serving Calculation**: Real-time cost estimation based on ingredient data.
- **Profit Margins**: Input sale prices to calculate per-item profit.
- **Yield Management**: Define recipe yield (e.g., 10 servings per batch).

### D. Responsive Mobile-First UI
- **Touch-Friendly Layouts**: Optimized for tablets and smartphones.
- **Fast Navigation**: Quick access to common actions (e.g., Add Order, Edit Menu).
- **Dark Mode (Optional)**: For low-light catering events or venues.
- **Offline Placeholder UI**: Graceful handling of network interruptions (planned).

## II. Firebase Integration

### Firestore Database Structure (Proposed):
- `users`: Authentication and user roles.
- `orders`: Orders, statuses, timestamps.
- `menu_items`: Item info, availability, category_id, recipe_id.
- `categories`: Menu grouping structure.
- `ingredients`: Ingredient info and costs.
- `recipes`: Ingredient relationships, yield, steps, cost breakdown.

### Firebase Services Used:
- **Authentication**: Admin login and user roles.
- **Cloud Firestore**: Real-time, scalable data storage.
- **Cloud Functions**: (Planned) for recipe recalculations, reporting.
- **Hosting**: Static hosting for React frontend.
